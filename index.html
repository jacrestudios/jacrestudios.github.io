      <h1>Adventure Background</h1>
      <p><span class="big">A</span>n ominous sign has appeared in the sky above the Kingdom of Astralith: a bright blue light that shines day and night.  A prophecy long ago told of a devastating meteor that would strike the land, destroying all life in the vicinity.  The kingdom is based around deep lakes and valleys from previous impacts, lending credence to the prophecy's truth.</p>
      <p>On counsel from the Archmage, the King has enacted martial law in order to build a device to save the Kingdom from the meteor, but in doing so has started to lose control of his generals who seek to make warlords of themselves.  </p>
      <p>The sudden change in law and seizing of property has sparked discontent among the people and a rebellion has broken out.  The Choice Alliance has formed to install a new democratic government and belives the meteor is a ruse by the King to strengthen his power. </p>
      <p>The Golden Guild has been perturbed by the King's declaration and seeks to use the rising rebellion as a chance to free themselves from the new taxes.  However, as a contingency to the meteor strike, the Guild is also building a massive fleet to move their wealth to a distant land.  </p>
      <p>The Church of Bahamut is disappointed in the King taking counsel from the Archmage over them.  They believe the meteor can be stopped, but only by divine intervention by one of Bahamut's chosen, leading to rising tensions as they denounce the martial law and Archmage in front of their congregations.</p>
      <p> Meanwhile a Cult of Lathander has started to take root in the area amongst the chaos, challenging the teachings of the Church.  Rumors are the cult has been cultivating priests and clerics since ancient times and are only now surfacing as the light in the sky appears once more.</p>
      <p>Foreign agents and mercenaries also roam the land seeking to sabotage the kingdom's attempts at preservation, mostly infiltrating from the pirate lands of Qiznaj and raider lands of Dramon.</p>
